To make the script work:
1. Make a 'creds.py' file in the source folder
   a. client_id = "{ADD_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID}"
   b. client_secret = "{ADD_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET}"
   c. redirect_uri = 'http://127.0.0.1:3000'
2. Install the required libraries:
   pip install opencv mediapipe numpy spotipy
3. Run the main.py file. On the first run, a dialogue box will open wherein spotify will ask for permissions. Read them and click on 'Okay'.
4. Enjoy!
